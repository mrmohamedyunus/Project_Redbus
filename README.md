Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium & Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit
Project Overview
The Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium & Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit project is designed to innovate the transportation sector by automating the collection and analysis of bus travel data. Through 
comprehensive web scraping, the project extracts critical information from the Redbus website, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. The data is then stored in a SQL database and 
visualized using an interactive Streamlit application. This project enables data-driven decision-making that can enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and support strategic 
planning in the transportation industry.
